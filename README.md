Project Name: MAYTHON: Mayo Implementation and showcase in python


---------------------------------------------------------------
Goal and Motivation:
---------------------------------------------------------------
MAYO is a cryptovariete quadratic cryptography scheme which is known for using a really complex system of quadratic formulas and bilinear combination to do its tasks. It is 
knwon for being very fast and adaptable as it addresses a lot of the main issues for mainstream schemes such as RSA while addressing advancements in regular and quantum
computers. 

The team that worked on it did a good job and still is active under NIST standards, so we would like to create a visual simulation of it using their own C implementation. This is done through our 
own implementation with Python which replicates the original C code but relies on Python's really neat libraries. We want to showcase how the scheme operates in thourough detail.
